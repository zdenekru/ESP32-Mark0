# ESP32-Mark0
 Firt trial to utilize ESP32-Wroom-32E NodeMCU with BME280 and eInk display
This is a learning project, full of mistakes so far, long way from being in order to work properly.
So far I had: 
  - relearned how to make symbols in KiCAD
  - how to make PCBs, especially fill zones to work properly
  - that there is a difference between ESP32 Devkit C6 "M" version and "C" version and they are not pin compatibile
